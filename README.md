# ThoughtSpot User Tool

ThoughtSpot user tools are a collection of tools for managing users and groups in ThoughtSpot as well as working with 
the ThoughtSpot Web APIs that contain users and groups.  The tools and Web APIs are all written in Python and 
require a Python environment in which to run.  The remainder of this document will describe how to deploy and use 
the tools and write your own custom applications based on the API wrappers.

## Deprecation Notice

TS User Tools is no longer maintained.  You can still use it if it fits your needs, but the APIs may change and break the tools.  
You should consider using [CS Tools User Management](https://thoughtspot.github.io/cs_tools/), which provides many of the same and new capabilities.

## Packages and scripts

The tools can be split into two broad categories.  The first category contains the scripts that you can run to directly do things.  
For example, the `get_users` script will let you get all of the users and groups from a running ThoughtSpot cluster.

The second category is the ThoughtSpot Web API Python wrappers.  These are all contained in the tsut package and 
categorized into modules based on functionality, such as writing sync applications, modeling users and groups and 
calling the APIs from Python scripts.

## Setup

User Tools is installed with the same process as other TS Python tools.

You can install using `pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/thoughtspot/user_tools`

See the general [documentation](https://github.com/thoughtspot/community-tools/tree/master/python_tools) on setting 
up your environment and install using `pip`.

## Running the pre-built tools

All of the pre-built tools are run using the general format: 

`python -m user_tools.<tool-name>`

Note there is no `.py` at the end and you *must* use `python -m`.  So for example to run `get_users` and see the 
options, you would enter `python -m user_tools.get_users --help`  Try it now and verify your environment is all set.

The user tools currently consist of four scripts:
1. `delete_ugs`, which deletes users and groups from a ThoughtSpot cluster.
2. `get_users` that can get users and groups from a ThoughtSpot cluster in multiple formats.
3. `sync_from_excel` that syncs ThoughtSpot from a properly formatted Excel document.  The format for the 
Excel document is the same as the one created by `get_users`.
4. `transfer_ownership` transfers all of the objects owned by one user to another.  Partial transfer of
ownership is not currently supported.

You might also notice a validate_json file that is a simple, command-line validator or JSON.  Use if 
you like.

### get_users

Retrieves all of the users and groups from a ThoughtSpot cluster and writes them to the output, a JSON file or Excel.

~~~

                    [--password PASSWORD] [--disable_ssl] [--group_privileges]

  --password PASSWORD   Password for login of the user to log in as.
  --disable_ssl         Will ignore SSL errors.
  --group_privileges    Will also retrieve the group privileges for all
                        groups. This could be slow.
  --output_type OUTPUT_TYPE
                        One of stdout, csv, xls, excel, or json.
  --filename FILENAME   Name of file to write to if not stdout. Required for

### sync_from_excel

## Writing Custom Scripts

While the pre-defined tools are convenient, they don't cover all possible scenarios.
See the [custom folder]("https://github.com/thoughtspot/user_tools/tree/master/custom") for details on how to write your own
sync script.
